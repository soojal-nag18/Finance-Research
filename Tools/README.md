## ðŸ“‚ Purpose

The **Tools** folder serves as a central place for all reusable code that helps gather, prepare, or transform data for research.  
By keeping these scripts organized, it ensures that workflows are transparent, repeatable, and easy to maintain as the project grows.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Scripts in this folder may depend on datasets stored in the `Data/` folder.
- Keep scripts clear, documented, and modular so they can be reused for multiple research tasks.
- Any new tools should follow a consistent structure and include brief explanations in comments where needed.
